Hi,

I am Ankit. I am an Engineer. Recently I started an Insta handle @yuthehexacopter and posted some of the
drone footages and snaps which I recetnly built.

### YU - The Hexacopter <a name="introduction"></a>

Introducing Vayu / YU / ‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ø‡•Å is an educational purpose Artificial Intelligence (AI) based hexacopter created for research of drone for Indian Scenerios. YU is self made hexacopter for learners - skilled from beginners to advance level drone makers and enthusiasts, interested in both Hardware & Software side of development. The hardware side includes Electronics Components and Software side includes including Data Science (DS) / Machine Learning (ML) / Internet of Things(IoT) and Computer Vision(CV).

Unmanned Arial Vehicle(UAV) is simplest structure which is designed to fly by a precalculated angular velocity and upward thrust. The fun part begins with automation. This particular drone is a flying linux computer. Infact a complete implemention of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that includes Machine Learning(ML), Computer Vision(openCV), and Internet of Things(IOT). The brain of UAV is usually a flight controller controlled by a Ground Control Station (GCS) - The remote control in your hand basically plus a laptop connected with telemetry in this case. BUT, when I put a bigger processing power above it, A Raspberry Pi, A Single Board Computer(SBC) in this case, the GCS fly with it, giving them instructions and collecting all the information without any manual intervention. NOW thats a perfect automation. ü§©ü§©ü§©

### The Blog
A lot of people who have come accross have been asking me question regarding the making of a drone. So, In my blog today, I will take you for a rollar-coster ride about how you make your own copter with all the Components available in the market today and play with it. All your questions have been summed-up here and you can always connect with me on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/yuthehexacopter/).

Well let start with the List of the Components. You need the following items in our inventory to make your own Copter.
These components are common for Quadcopter / Hexacopter as a carrier or racing drones.
